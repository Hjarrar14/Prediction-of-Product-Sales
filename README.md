# Exploratory Data Analysis

### In this project, we used four types of plots, each serving a specific purpose for displaying and understanding the data.

  - *Histograms to view the distributions of numerical features.*
    
  - *Boxplots to view statistical summaries of numerical features.*
    
  - *Countplots to view the frequency of each class of categorial features.*
    
  - *Heatmap to view the correlation between features.*
